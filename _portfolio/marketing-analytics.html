<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This project simulates a retail business that is facing a drop in customer engagement 
  and conversion rates, despite the launching of several new marketing campaigns.
</p>
<p>These are the main key points the company wishes to solve:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reduced Customer Feedback</strong>: The number of feedback entries and engagement with the site has declined</li>
  <li><strong>High Marketing Expenses</strong>: Significant investments in marketing campaigns don’t have the expected returns</li>
  <li><strong>Need for Customer Feedback Analysis</strong>: Understanding customer opinions about the products and services is crucial for improving engagement and conversions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Source</h2>

<p>
  The original dataset and business problem were created by Ali Ahmad, which inspired this project.

  <li><strong>Customer Reviews Table:</strong> Analyzes customer feedback to identify common themes</li>
  <li><strong>Customer Table:</strong> Provides additional information about customers</li>

  <li><strong>Product Table:</strong> Provides additional information about products</li>
</ul>

<h2>Findings</h2>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Since this is fictional data, the dataset includes information for the entire year of 2025. However, since the year is not complete, I will only interpret the data related to 2023 and 2024.</p>

  <li>The average conversion rate by year decreased by 3.5% from 2023 to 2024, with the lowest conversion rate occurring in May 2024 (4.5%), a drop of 4.4% compared to the previous year.</li>
