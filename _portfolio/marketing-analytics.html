<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This project simulates a retail business that is facing a drop in customer engagement 
  and conversion rates, despite the launching of several new marketing campaigns.
</p>
<p>These are the main key points the company wishes to solve:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reduced Customer Feedback</strong>: The number of feedback entries and engagement with the site has declined</li>
  <li><strong>High Marketing Expenses</strong>: Significant investments in marketing campaigns don’t have the expected returns</li>
  <li><strong>Need for Customer Feedback Analysis</strong>: Understanding customer opinions about the products and services is crucial for improving engagement and conversions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Source</h2>

<p>
  The original dataset and business problem were created by Ali Ahmad, which inspired this project.
