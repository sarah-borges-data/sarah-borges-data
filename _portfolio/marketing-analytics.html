# Marketing Analytics Project using Power BI

## Introduction
This project simulates a retail business that is facing a drop in customer engagement and conversion rates, despite the launching of several new marketing campaigns.
These are the main key points the company wishes to solve:
    - **Reduced Customer Feedback**: The number of feedback entries and engagement with the site has declined
    - **High Marketing Expenses**: Significant investments in marketing campaigns don’t have the expected returns
    - **Need for Customer Feedback Analysis**: Understanding customer opinions about the products and services is crucial for improving engagement and conversions
